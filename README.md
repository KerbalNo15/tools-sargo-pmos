**My postmarketOS Experiments**

This is a little repo where I put things I make for my Google Pixel 3a running postmarketOS.

***Description of Utilities***
- Feedbackd Notification Connector is a utility for connecting user D-bus notifications to feedbackd. Created to make Telegram Desktop messages vibrate (sort of an important phone function)
- Chromium application overrides are tweaks to make Chromium usable- exceedingly so. IMO this is the best browser for pmos once you get it working.
- Easy Effects Configurations may help you with audio quality on the internal speaker.
