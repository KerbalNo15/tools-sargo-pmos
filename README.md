**My postmarketOS Experiments**

This is a little repo where I put things I make for my Google Pixel 3a running postmarketOS.

***Description of Utilities***
- Feedbackd Notification Connector is a utility for connecting user D-bus notifications to feedbackd. Created to make Telegram Desktop messages vibrate (sort of an important phone function)
- Chromium application overrides are tweaks to make Chromium usable- exceedingly so. IMO this is the best browser for pmos once you get it working.
- Telegram Desktop Tweaks is a list of configuration options you can set to make Telegram Desktop behave like a mobile app.
- The VoLTE guide is my attempt to describe how to get VoLTE working, since there doesn't seem to be a condensed guide at this time.
