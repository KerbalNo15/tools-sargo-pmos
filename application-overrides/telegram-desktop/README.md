**Telegram Desktop**

Actually works really well on mobile. List of things you (probably) want to do:
- Settings -> Notifications and Sounds = uncheck "Draw attention to the window"
- Settings -> Interface Scale = 330%
- Settings -> Advanced -> When window closed = Run in the background
- Settings -> Advanced -> System integration = check "Launch Telegram when system starts" and "Launch minimized"
- Settings -> Advanced -> Battery and Animations = turn off "Interface animations"
- Settings -> Advanced -> Hardware accelerated video decoding = on

See also the Feedbackd notification connector in this repo, since without it you won't get vibration feedback when
people message you.
