**General Notes for Applications**

You should probably be aware that, at least in GNOME-mobile,
 **the keyboard doesn't come up automatically in many programs**.
This seems like a deal-breaker, but be advised that this is not an issue at all because
**double-tapping the gesture hint at the bottom of the screen brings up the keyboard anywhere**
